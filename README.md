After searching the web for a long time, i couldn't find a good source FiveM ready cars. All what i found was Add-ons that need to be converted  and need some work to do, so for example if you want to install like 20 addon car to your server that will take you more than 2 hours, at least  in my case. And i'm sure a lot of you just like me!
 
So here is a ready FiveM ready cars pack, You can just go into the company name for example BMW, and you'll find all converted and ready-to-use   cars.
 
I'll try to keep this up to date as much as i can.
 
Your feedback is much appreciated.

### How to install

In each vehicle folder you will see READ-ME - Important.txt, read that to know the change you have to make.
you are adviced to changed folder to be the same vehicle name, spawn name. I don't think it's required, but it's better. Correct me if i'm wrong.

Do not upload special characters or use non english folder names, that will not work.

Use the server.cfg and copy it's content to your own server.cfg WARNING: DO NOT REPLACE!!!.
