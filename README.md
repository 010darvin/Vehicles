After searching the web for a long time, i couldn't find a good source FiveM ready cars. All what i found was Add-ons that need to be converted  and need some work to do, so for example if you want to install like 20 addon car to your server that will take you more than 2 hours, at least  in my case. And i'm sure a lot of you just like me!

Your feedback is much appreciated.

### How to install

In each vehicle folder you will see READ-ME - Important.txt, read that to know the change you have to make.
you are adviced to changed folder to be the same vehicle name, spawn name. [optional].

Do not upload special characters or use non english folder names, that will not work.

Use the server.cfg and copy it's content to your own server.cfg WARNING: DO NOT REPLACE!!!.
Note: server.cfg is not up-to-date. There is too many cars that we didn't add to the server config because that's just unnecessarily. The current server.cfg will remain and we WILL NOT update it anymore, you can manually add the start line in your config so you know what you add and what you have in your server, which is better for server owners to get more contorl over.
